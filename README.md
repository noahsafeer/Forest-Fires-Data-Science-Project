# Forest-Fires-Data-Science-Project

Conclusion
The model for predicting the amount of forest fires is 99% accurate and predicts the amount of fires very well. This is because of the strong relationship that the amount of fires
has with location. The model for predicting the size of fires is only 49% accurate due to there not being any variables that are great indicators.
